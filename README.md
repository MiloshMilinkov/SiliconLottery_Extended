The "Silicon Lottery" project is a graduate thesis from the subject "Integration of Software Technologies". Basically, "Silicon Lottery" is an e-commerce web application that will simulate the operation of an online store for the purpose of selling computer equipment.

The project will be done with the help of three technologies.
1. AngularJs
2. .NET Web API (.NET 7.0.3)
